Technical documentation for sysadmins/developers/etc working on Appropedia

## Welcome

Welcome to Appropedia's shell account, mysterious future tech person!

Here is a bunch of documentation you might find useful.  It's part of a 
github repo you can find at https://github.com/Appropedia/techdocs and 
the repo is cloned into ~/docs on our VPS server account.

## Start here

Some good docs to read for starters:

* ssh.md -- how/why to use ssh to access the shell account
* shell.md -- shell account notes, including directory layout
* github.md -- using github to update these docs (and other stuff)
