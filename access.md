# Access required to work on Appropedia

If you are doing tech/admin work on Appropedia (eg. upgrading the wiki),
you will need the following access:

* Dreamhost panel, including permission to modify users (this is needed
  to change fully-hosted domain settings, for some reason)
* Shell access -- see ssh.md for info on setting up your SSH key so
  you can login to the shell.
* Wiki admin status -- this will give you access to various admin tools
  on the wiki, eg. http://www.appropedia.org/Special:SMWAdmin
* Trello tech board -- you should have access to the board on
  http://trello.com/ where Appropedia keeps track of tech tasks to be
  done.
